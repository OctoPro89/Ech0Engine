<h2>Ech0Engine</h2>
Ech0Engine is an OpenGL3d game engine that I am working on that is written in C++ for effeciency

Just added model loading support for gltf
and Scene loading support.

If you wanna use your own models; Have the texture as png or jpeg,
then have the gltf and bin files. Edit Scene1.hpp and replace the "Model("Models/yourModelName" and also put it in the build folder not game folder

I know gltf is not the best format I am trying to create a obj loader because gltf is annoying but it is what I have as of now
