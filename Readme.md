<h2>Ech0Engine</h2>
Ech0Engine is an OpenGL3d game engine that I am working on that is written in C++ for effeciency

Just added model loading support for gltf
and Scene loading support.

I know gltf is not the best format I am trying to create a obj loader because gltf is annoying but it is what I have as of now

This may eventually become public, but for now I'm not uploading the code for my Engine
